# Microcontrollers and Microprocessors

Repository used for Microcontrollers and Microprocessors course at IFPB during the semester 2016.1. This is a student repository, so this is my course point of view. If you want to check professor's, please visit [this link](http://aperta.me/2TF "Professor's page").

- **Week 1**: Presentation of the course, some basic information about Microcontrollers and Microprocessors (PIC, Arduino, ESP), Proteus (ISIS and ARES) and Arduino IDE.
- **Week 2**: Getting used to Arduino codes to blink some LEDs and counting from 0 to 99 using 7 segment display, details about `setup()` and `loop()`, how to use serial terminal (arduino code and simulation).
